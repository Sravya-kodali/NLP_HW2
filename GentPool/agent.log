Abstract:   
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a topic of growing interest and investigation in various 
fields, including higher education. This research article explores the impact of AI on higher 
education by examining its effects on teaching and learning, assess ment, ethics, required skills, and 
future careers. The aim of this study is to analy se the influence of AI on higher education, 
investigate its impact on the teaching and learning process, examine its effect on assessment and 
grading, and predict its influ ence on graduates' future careers. To accomplish this, the study 
employs a qualitative approach based on a survey of the higher education audience.  The results of 
this study demonstrate the crucial role of AI in the future of higher education. The findings  
highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of AI in equipping graduates with new skills for their 
future careers. They also emphasi se the importance of considering the ethical implications of AI. 
The study reveals that higher education institutions need t o integrate AI more extensively in their 
programs to prepare graduates for the future workforce.  
AI has the potential to revolutionize education by personalizing teaching methods to suit individual 
student needs, providing prompt feedback, and automating a dministrative tasks. It can also assist 
in grading and assessment, freeing educators to focus on developing curriculum and providing 
quality instruction. The study findings suggest that AI has a positive impact on the learning 
experience by facilitating th e acquisition of new knowledge and skills.  This research provides 
insights into the potential of AI to transform higher education and contribute to the development 
of new skills for graduates. It has important implications for educators, policy -makers, and  other 
stakeholders in the higher education sector. The study findings suggest that AI should be more 
extensively integrated into higher education curricula, and that institutions need to consider the 
ethical implications of AI in the development and imple mentation of their programs. By doing so, 
they can better prepare graduates for the demands of the future workforce.

 1.      Introduction:  
     Artificial intelligence (AI) is a vast branch of computer science concerned with 
developing intelligent computers capable of doing tasks that typically need human intelligence. 
Siri, Alexa, self -driving cars, Robo -advisors, talking bots, and email spam fil ters are examples 
of AI (Stanford Encyclopaedia  of Philosophy, 2020) . AI is the world’s new trend as it has 
proved more efficient in m any fields, mainly during the COVID -19 pandemic (Vaishya et al., 
2020). AI helped fight the virus and globally rescued jobs and educational systems (UNESCO, 
2020). Thus, it is vital to shedding light on how AI will impact one of the essential areas of life, 
higher education. This research article studies how AI impacts higher education based on 
previous studies and participants’ experienc es, views, and predictions.  
2.       Literature review  
      Currently, AI has become a vital part of the virtual world. Unquestionably, AI plays an 
important  role in general education and higher education (Edtech, 2020) . For example, the 
efficient uses of filtering emails, advertising, applications, YouTube, and virtual assistants such 
as Google, digital libraries, Goog le Scholar, and other digital research engines in any higher 
institution worldwide (García-Vélez et al., 2021) . However, AIoth is weak and robust, 
according to Ma & Siau (2018). In other words, Ma and Siau (2018 ) label AI as fragile when 
it is limited to small, restricted,  and structured tasks such as collecting data. The latter 
researesearchersAI as sharp and robust when performing most or all cognitive tasks are 
typically human (Beight & Reddell, 2005) . Although AI plays a vita l role currently, the 
researchers mentioned above consider AI a threat to human civilisation and support their 
argument with what experts in the field think about AI, such as Bill Gates, Elon Musk and 
Stephen Hawking (Ma & Siau, 2018) . Undeniably, what is mentioned above about AI is vital. 
Still, at the same tim e, it is questionable for any critical -thinking reader as any further 
investigation remains possible, and the truth is never absolute. So, how would AI impact the 
learning and teaching processes?  
2.1         AI impact on the learning and teaching process  
           Dealing with the impact of AI on learning and teaching in higher education, it is 
evident that AI will impact higher education in many ways and mainly in two focal areas: 
enrollment and curriculum (Taneri, 2020) . For instance, Ma and Siau (2018) maintain that AI 
will speed consistency and accuracy in curriculum and registration. Furthermore, according to 
Ma and Siau (2018), hum an sciences and liberal arts majors will become more popular because 
these areas of study are less vulnerable to the field of AI than other areas, such as accounting 
and finance (Ma & Siau, 2018) .  
          Although this study is essential for a load of information on the influence of AI on 
higher education, it  can be criticised for not tackling the issue genuinely, as the impact is much 
more profound. Indeed, focusing on the learning and teaching process, no one would doubt 
that AI is replacing the lecturer or tutor in many ways, such as blended learning and e -learning. 
The presence of an e -learning lecturer is limited as the learner interacts with a virtual 
classroom, whether on Blackboard, Moodle, Turnitin or any other platform (Jlu & Laurie A, 
2018). Equally,  Professor Roland T Chin from Hong Kong Ba ptist University (2018) believes 
that AI is meant to revolutionise how we learn, teach, work, live, make decisions, and be ready 
for the AI era. Therefore, AI is not only about its superficial effect, but about radical changes 
in the teaching and learning process in depth (Chin, 2018) .   
What reinforces this idea conditionally is the argument from Princeton’s Head of 
Computer Science, Jennifer Rexford. She surmises that AI is efficient in learning and European Jo urnal of Educational Sciences, March 2023 edition Vol.10 No.1  ISSN: 1857 - 6036 
 
19 
 teaching if others learn:  “Learning  how people learn will hopefully help us and others think 
more broadly about retraining down the road” (Rexford, 2018) . Hence, according to 
Jennifer, the efficienc y of AI is provisional, as understanding learning styles is the only key 
to success. Alike, Jabar and Yousif (2011) argue that the learning process in this world is 
becoming more interactive and engaging, according to recent researchers, because e -
learning provides the learner with artistic and pedagogical features as well as incorporates 
and deals with countless types of content which react effectively to the students’ needs 
(Jabar and Yousif, 2011) .  
The absence of striking examples of how AI impacts the learner’s daily life can be 
a limitation of the approach of  Jabar and Yousif, highlighted below in the Education and 
Unit Study. For example, AI provides deep learning and teaching processes to get high er 
performance from both the tutor and the tutee. For example, adopting hypermedia for a 
writing class facilitates mistakes and reduces time consumption. For example, before 
discovering AI, it took ages for a teacher to assess and grade papers and check fo r 
plagiarism. Thanks to AI, checking for academic integrity and language issues takes 
minutes or less. Indeed, using artificial intelligence,  a lecturer submits the work to Turnitin, 
Grammarly, or other software. In minimal time, it can provide constructiv e feedback based 
on the results generated by the software used.  
Although  AI is perfect in covering language and academic integrity issues, 
semantic, pragmatic, and cognitive levels, in many cases, require the intervention of the 
human mind to perform the last touch  (Mellul, 2018) . Nevertheless, AI offers various 
learners links about the topics required by the subject matter and eases and inspires both 
learner and tutor by addressing different learning styles such as autonomous learning, visual 
learning, e -learning, audio -visual learning, and deep learning. Equally, AI enables the tutor 
to select and apply the learning method taxonomy that the learner needs and highlights the 
areas of improvement to be focused on (Jabar and Yousif, 20 11).   Meanwhile,  AI reinforces 
independent learning as the learner becomes autonomous and free to access input anytime 
and anywhere. Finally, according to Richer (1985) , AI positively influences education by 
providing intelligent computer -assisted inst ruction that facilitates learning intuition and 
provides expert systems to diagnose and assess learning outcomes  (Richer, 1985) . It is 
undoubtedly clear that AI adds a lot to the learning and teaching process, so what about 
assessments and grading?  
 
2.2       Impact of AI  on the assessment  and classification  process  
AI does not impact only the learning and teaching process but also the assessing and 
grading process. For instance, AI checks assignments and research projects through 
software such as Turnitin against billions of resources in no time. Consequently, simila rities 
are easily  generated  to judge whether the learner plagiarised. Similarly, online rubrics and 
grading forms are added to assignments with criteria and scales, and final grades are 
automatically added to the submitted work without any hassle (Mahana et al., 2012) . 
Furthermore, AI offers interactive way s of providing constructive feedback to the learner, 
easy access in a relaxed manner anytime and anywhere, with more privacy and autonomy. 
Additionally, the instructor can write or record feedback to facilitate and improve learning 
from errors.  
Also, referring to a study by Stanford University, AI is applied to evaluate students’ 
responses and create a computer model that endorses  rules inferred from the tutor's grading European Jo urnal of Educational Sciences, March 2023 edition Vol.10 No.1  ISSN: 1857 - 6036 
 
20 
 decisions. What is specific about AI is that it improves learning instead of making a fi nal 
authoritative decision. In addition,  it reflects more transparency, trust, and quality control 
(Stanford U niversity, 2019) . In the same context, Tovia Smith, in her article “More states 
opting to Robo -Grade’ Student Essays by computer,” argues that rob -graders ( robots used 
for grading students’ papers) are increasingly used to grade students’ essays mainly  in Utah, 
Ohio and soon Massachusetts to follow (Brad Rose Consulting, 2019) . Similarly, a research 
professor at Colorad o University named Peter Foltz says they have AI techniques that can 
judge up to 100 features and that grading essay is highly accurate (Brad Rose Consulting, 
2019). In short, artificial intelligence  is playing a more prominent role in the evaluation  and 
classification of  higher education in the United States of America.  
Though the above studies are valuable from different perspectives in addressing the 
role of AI in grading and assessing the learner and facilitating the role of the instructor, a 
critical thinker would not fail to pose the following questions: What about b ias in marking 
reports? Who would guarantee that AI is fair and objective? What about the human side of 
the learning process and assessment? Will AI consider the psychology of learner grading 
or assessing a paper?  
 
2.3       AI Impact  on Future Careers of Gra duates  
AI affects the world of education, but it also seems restricted to this area and follows 
the learner even after graduation. For instance, according to Wang and Si au (2017), AI will 
impact the future job market of required skillsets.  It will replace many other studies that 
involve routine tasks and structures that are easy to automate instead of unstructured 
disciplines that require complex cognitive interference (Wang & Siau, 2017) . AI or 
computer assessment is not limited to grading papers but can be the gateway to a future 
career. For instance, a human may not read CVs but be screened by an algorithm specialised 
in candidate shortlisting. As an ex ample, in an article by the Economist entitled “How 
algorithms may decide your career: getting a job means getting past the computer”, it is 
reported that the largest firms are now using computer programs or algorithms to select 
candidates with an applican t tracking system (ATS) which can reject up to 75% of 
candidates. The above policy pushed applicants to use keywords to maximise  screening 
interests (Brad Rose Consulting, 2019) .  
Vodafone and Intel are not satisfied with shortlisting CVs but instead use a 
computer -driven visual interviews service called “HireVue ” to further select candidates. In 
this process,  AI analyses facial expressions and language patterns and decides to pass or 
fail the applicant (Brad Rose Consulting, 2019) . According to a study by Frey & Osborne 
(2013), the number of jobs at risk that will be computerised and include advances in robotics 
and machine learning is roughly 47% of US total employment  (Frey & Osborne, 2013) . 
Likewise, Dizikes (2020) re fers to research conducted by Daron Acemoglu and Pascual 
Resrego from MIT   University that each added robot replaces 5.6 workers, almost equal to 
six people  (Dizikes, 2020) .  
Similarly, similar research conducted by Ma & Siau (2018)  of Oxford University 
argues that within the next 20 years, around 47% of jobs in the United States of America 
and almost 54% in Europe are at risk due to AI  (Ma & Siau, 2018) . Additionally, the latter 
researchers at Oxford University forecast that AI will write hi gh-school essays by 2026, 
write best -selling books by 2049, translate languages by 2024 and perform surgeries by 
2053. Chin (2018) from Hong Kong University argues that there are overlooked AI European Jo urnal of Educational Sciences, March 2023 edition Vol.10 No.1  ISSN: 1857 - 6036 
 
21 
 examples or less obvious ones such such  as translation machines  that enable you to speak 
to anyone with any language instantaneously. Chin (2018) added that JPMorgan Chase and 
Co use a learning machine that deals with loan agreement  processes and saves 360 000 
hours of work by accountants and lawyers (Chin, 2018) . 
Although all the values stated above about how AI is creeping into the career world, 
Ma and Siau (2018) criticise these aspects arguing that when it comes to soft skills such as 
empathy, communication, collaboration, innovation,  critical thinking, problem solving,  and 
leadership, AI is not as robust as human cognitive ability (Ma & Siau, 2018) . Both 
researchers reinforce their views by suggesting that  higher institutions should provide soft 
and hard skills such as maths, IT, and engineering while training students. They think AI 
may not be capable of affording these skills for future business careers (Ma & Siau, 2018) . 
Although computer -driven screening is believed to avoid biases in the traditional 
recruitment process, AI is not bias -free. That algorithm can favour  candidates with time 
and money to continually re-tool their resumes (Brad Rose Consulting, 2019) . 
To end the conflict with a culminating result, Chin (2018)  argues that citizens of the 
new world order require new skills. These skills should include int erpersonal skills such as 
adaptability, critical thinking, conflict resolution capabilities,  and other cognitive skills. 
Steve Jobs thinks, 'It is technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities  
that yields us the results that make ou r heart sing' (Henn et al., 2005) . How would higher 
education impact AI?  Undoubtedly, the world is getting more innovative, and AI has 
rehabilitated our world by putt ing natural languages and data by enabling Siri, Netflix, 
Facebook, Google, Alexa, Amazon, and many other platforms as part of our daily life 
(Oblinger, 2018) . However, the que stion arises: How will higher education affect AI? This 
research paper will address these issues from the two focal points of ethics and cognition 
as answers to these issues.  
 
2.4       Cognitive and ethical impacts of higher education on AI  
Dealing with ethics in AI is a lecturer in learning science and innovation at the 
Institute of Educational Technology in the UK. Holmes  (2018), discussing the impact of AI 
on education, raised the importance of adopting ethics in AI education. The same lecturer 
argues that whether we like it or not, AI is being deployed in higher institutions worldwide 
and significantly impacts the future of higher education. Similarly, he adds that by 2024 the 
global AIED market will be worth 4.5 billion pounds. Companies such as Googl e, 
Facebook, and Amazon invest millions of dollars in developing AI in education (Drabwell, 
2018).  
However,  Holmes (2018) believes that 'adaptive'  or 'personali sed' ethical learning 
systems are not entirely taken into account. He also stressed that  there is a 'moral vacuum'  
without guidelines, policies, regulations,  or research done to stress the specific ethical 
issues raised by AI in education (Holmes, 2018) . The question is not a question of data for 
him, but instead is an issue o f morality and that is why he asks: “How can we be sure that 
the data are accurate, who owns and controls the data, and how is student privacy 
maintained?”  According to Holmes (2018), AIED ethics should not be reduced to 
questioning data and controlling th e potential of bias that is incorporated in AIED 
computational approaches, algorithms, and the decisions taken by the AI’s deep neural 
networks that are not quickly inspected and that he describes as “known unknowns” 
(Holmes, 2018) .” Whether anyone likes it or not, AI has quietly entered the university European Jo urnal of Educational Sciences, March 2023 edition Vol.10 No.1  ISSN: 1857 - 6036 
 
22 
 campus, but little attention has been paid to ethics. To give just one example, what happens 
if a student is subjected to a  limited set of algorithms that impact negatively and incorrectly 
on their assessments?” What is inferred from this study is that higher education should give 
more importance to the ethical part while teaching AI.  
To address the ethical issue of AI,  and as an example, Open University in the UK 
conducted workshops involving researchers around the world  on AIED in 2018  at the AI 
in Education  International Conference. Participants  considered the importance of doing 
empirical work to address systematic biases in learning machine models and create 
impenetrable algorithm  black boxes and AI ethics -driven courses. Therefore, Open 
University started using “Chatbots”, an internet -based program designed to simulate 
conversation with users. Communicates  through text me ssages through websites, 
applications, or instant messengers to support students and staff (Drabwell, 2018) . 
Likewise, higher education institutions should think  of security and privacy issues. When 
it comes to AI, these burning issues, despite the rosy promises of AI humans, have to 
address this ethical issue, with intelligent systems monitoring our faces 24 hours a day with 
only a few elements of our private lif e remaining untouched. Are there legal frameworks, 
policies, or ethical codes to control the brutality of AI? Moreover, we should consider robot 
cops and their ability to kill and hold them without human ethics.  
AI raises many social issues that are more complex than technological ones, such as ethics, 
privacy, and inequality, which entails that we need STEM and technology graduates and 
graduates who are deeply grounded in humanities and arts. With liberal arts education, 
intellectual and ethical grow th will be an opportunity that integrates compassion, civic -
minded citizens, responsibility, and ethics.  
 
2.5       Cognitive impact of higher education on AI  
      Thinking cognitively, AI has made it a present -day reality that imitates  humans in 
many functi ons such as language translation, medical diagnostics, and decision making.  If 
humans interact, analyse, deduce, think logically, and reason contextually, AI performs 
these actions artificially based on powerful computers, high -speed internet connections, 
algorithms and extensive real -time data (Chin, 2018) . 
However, unlike humans’ AI performs fixed and domain -specific tasks with 
unmatched learning speed, extensive data, excellent efficiency and unlimited computing 
capacity. On the contrary, humans learn flexibly, pose, and solve issues creatively, think 
critically, and innovate adaptively (Chin, 2018) . Despite the above facts about humans, AI, 
deep learning, and ample data supply, AI has surpassed average human performance in 
manufacturing automation and face recognition. For exa mple, it is expected to perform 
enormous tasks (Chin, 2018) . Professor Ronald T Chin relates a story of two robots trained 
to communicate at a sophisticated level. They were found later speaking to each other in a 
language th ey had developed, which spooked the scientist and caused him to shut down the 
project. Therefore, AI may not be as cooperative as expected (Chin, 2018) . Here lies the 
question, what have higher education institutions done to monitor and control the cognitive 
wilderness of AI? The issue is not creating a sophisticated language that humans would not 
grasp, but more than that. Even more astonishing is that  their idea of embedding AI in 
human intelligence is forthcoming. Scientist s think of hardwiring human brains to implant 
a neuro-electronic chip into human heads, enabling communication via voice or texts 
through the cloud to brain signals that connect the internet (Chin, 2018) .  European Jo urnal of Educational Sciences, March 2023 edition Vol.10 No.1  ISSN: 1857 - 6036 
 
23 
 Recently in 2017 an d in many TV talk shows around the world,  a humanoid robot 
named Sophia developed in Hong Kong dazzled audiences by officially joining a recent 
United Nations Summit as a panelist to address issues of inequality  and said: “The future 
is already here. It is not very evenly distributed. If we are smarter and focused on win-win 
results, AI could help to efficiently  distribute the existing resources of the world, such as  
food and energy”  (Guardian News, 2017) . Again, where is the role of the higher institution 
in creating a boundary for empowering the AI with highly sophisticated cognitive skills 
that transgress the human mind and frees itsel f from the human aspect as the robot killer 
and robot cop and perhaps much more? Against this tremendous growth in the AI world, 
one should not forget that progress has been made by improving people and not improving 
machines, as the science fiction author  Tchaikovsky (2018)  argues.   In short, this statement 
empowers humans over AI because any cognitive intelligence AI owns, first of all, is 
inherited or programmed by a human mind that can ultimately  control this potential (Chin, 
2018).  
 
3.         Situation of the problem  
The twenty -first century has posed many challenges to the new world order. The 
influence of AI on higher education and the impact of higher education on AI are two 
crucial areas, among many others, worth studying (United Nations, 2018) . Thus, the 
research questions of this article are: What is the impact of AI on higher education? 
Alternatively, how is higher education going to impact AI?  
Aims of the study  
[1] To study the impact of AI on higher education.  
[2] Investigate  the impact of  AI on the learning and teaching process.  
[3] To study AI impact on the assessments and grading process  
[4] To predict the impact of  AI on future careers of graduates  
 
4.       Method  
          This research paper uses objec tivism as a philosophy, as the data collected are based 
on perceptions, feelings, and experiences. Objectivism entails realism, and ontologically, it 
considers social entities as physical ones making the world independently (Saunders et al., 
2009). Therefore , this article uses the qualitative method to investigate the topic raised. The 
qualitative approach focuses on collecting data from people’s experiences, views, and 
feelings dealing with AI in higher education and life in general (Hammersley, 2012) . A 
qualitative survey wa s used to ensure the quality and authenticity of the data collected. The 
survey comprises ten questions aligned with the research paper topic forwarded to 
participants via Office 365 Form (Treharne & Riggs, 2015). The survey targeted an 
audience made of higher education students (50), academic staff (34), decision -makers and 
managers (8). The audience comprises international academic staff, students, managers, 
and decision -makers with different cultural an d educational backgrounds. Overall, 92 
participants responded that they are both men (62) and women (30) aged between 20 and 
60 years and are current students and academic staff from different institutions. The survey 
link was shared on Facebook with selec ted colleagues and alums students who have a 
background in higher education and AI to ensure the validity of data collected from 
different countries during the academic year 2020 -21. The first question was created to 
ensure that participants belong to the higher education field. If not, then he/she is eliminated European Jo urnal of Educational Sciences, March 2023 edition Vol.10 No.1  ISSN: 1857 - 6036

 automatically. The survey targeted participants worldwide via a link  forwarded via emails, 
Facebook, and WhatsApp to ease participants’ contribution (Liang & Zhu, 2017) .  
 
Figure 1. Participants’ educational level  
 
4.1       Material  
Data collection was based on primary and secondary data. The preliminary data was 
collected through a qualitative survey and secondary data was collected by investigating 
previous studies. The secondary data used mainly academic resources from the Web of 
Science, Scopus, ERIC and Emerald, and limited grey literature.  
 
4.2       Data analysis  
Data analysis is deconstructing data and breaking down data collected into 
categories and codes. Then, interpretation by giving a sense of and understanding of the 
principles generated and exploring theories would help explain relationships. Finally, 
reconstruct data by sy stematically recreating and repackaging the significant themes and 
codes (Sergeant, 2012).  
5.      Findings  
The results collected through the survey reveal that AI will significantly impact 
higher education in many areas, such as learning and teaching method s, assessing and 
grading, skills required for future work, and future graduate careers.  
 
5.1       AI impact on the learning and teaching process  
First, concerning the idea that AI affects higher education,  the results reveal that 
most agree with 73 “Yes” that AI affects higher education. However, 17 participants think 
'Maybe' and only 2 say 'No' AI will not impact higher education.

5.4       Cognitive and ethical impacts of higher education on AI  
Concerning the impact of higher education on AI  from the ethical and cognitive 
levels, 45 participants think higher education impacts the ethical, cognitive, and human 
sides. Overall, humanity comes second with 19 votes, cognitive ability with 17 votes, and 
ethics with 1 1 votes.

6.       Discussion  
6.1        AI impact on the learning and teaching process  
       The impact of AI on higher education is made clear as 79% of the participants think 
“Yes” compared to 19% who think “Maybe” and only 2 % who contradict the idea by 
saying “No”. These results support what was discussed earlier  in the literature review 
(Rexford, 2018)  in reinforcing the idea that AI will significantly impact the future o f higher 
education (Tuomi et al., 2018) . Likewise, regarding  the efficiency of AI in learning and 
teaching, a big part of the participants believe that AI is more efficient than humans: 43 % 
strongly agree, and 15% agree with this idea, in contrast with 7% who strongly disagree, 
10% who disagree, and 25 % are neutral. Again the results agree strongly with Brad Rose's 
thoughts (Brad Rose Consulting, 2019)  and discussed earlier in Mahana, Johns and Apte 
(2012).  
 
6.2        Impact of AI  on the assessment and classification  process  
       Similarly, regarding AI's efficiency, accuracy, and objectivity in assessing learners, 
results reveal that the majority agree with this point, as 25% strongly agree and 50% agree, 
compared to 10% strongly disagree, 4% disagree, and 1 % who are neutral. The  findings 
agree with Brad Rose's (2019) perceptions about AI's efficiency in grading and accuracy 
(Brad Rose Consulting, 20 19). The results agree with what Brad Rose Consulting (2019) 
believes and Chin (2018) believes.  
 
6.3        AI Impact  on Future Careers of Graduates   
       The last point concerns the impact of AI on students’ future careers. The findings 
say that those who think it will negatively impact future careers of students  are as follows: 
54 % believe it will positively impact them. In comparison, 43% believe positiv ely and 
negatively, and 3% think that  AI will negatively impact future careers. Therefore,  the 
findings agree again with what was discussed in the literature review by Global Business 
Outlook (2018) and Chin (2018). Additionally, regarding the recruitment recruitment 
recruitment recruitment  process using AI, the the the the  findings reveal that the majority

 method with a percentage of 54%, compared  to a minority choosing  an artificially 
intelligent approach with a percentage of 3%, and this is an example that justifyes  their 
choice: “I prefer to be assessed by a human because a human can understand what you 
mean more than a robot. For example, in exams, students can write an answer that makes 
sense but is not available in the book so that the robot can mark that as a wrong answer, 
but the human will mark it as a right answer. ' 
    The latter results contradict what was discussed in the literature  review, as 
researchers think that automation will be used in interviewing and shortlisting candidates 
(Wang & Siau, 2017)  and (Global Business Outlook, 2018) . Similarly, 77% of participants 
prefer a human to 23 % who fancy robots being interviewed by robots or humans. This 
finding is not reflected deeply in Frey and Osborne's (2013 think) and is used nowadays by 
Vodafone and other organisations, as mentioned earlier in the literature review . 
Finally, concerning the necessity to learn new skills to meet the requirements of the 
AI era, the the the the the  findings reveal that 83% of the the the the the  participants think 
'Yes'. In comparison, 15% assume “Maybe”, and only 2% feel “No.” Therefore, the results 
agree strongly with what was discussed in the literature review that higher education 
institutions should prepare learners for the new world order of AI (Frey and Osborne, 2013).  
 
6.4        Cognitive and ethical impacts of higher education on AI  
       Regarding the impact of higher education on AI ethically, humanly and cognitively, 
49% of the participants think higher education should impact the human, cognitive and 
ethical aspects. However, 21% of the contributors believe in the human element compared  
to 18% who favour cognitive abilities as a second priority, and only 12% thought ethically. 
The findings reveal a significant concern with all aspects together, which is in harmony 
with what was raised earlier in the literature review in that AI should go  hand in hand with 
ethics, as Chin (2018) (Chin, 2018)  argues when he talked about liberal arts, humanity and 
AI combination. Not only Chin (2018) raised this point but also Guardian News (2017) and 
the example of human -robot talking about equality in the world,  as well as Holmes (2018)  
as he focused a lot on putting ethical rules for AI.  
 
7.     Recommendations:  
Based on the findings and issues raised in this research paper, the researcher 
recommends that applying AI in higher education is a requirement for all higher institutions. 
However, AI appliance suggests that academic staff should be well trained in using AI to 
equip learners with the required skills to face future care challenges. Similarly, the 
researcher recommends highlighting ethics and humanity first when teaching AI, as it 
threatens humankind without these values. Furthermore,  privacy and dignity should be 
respected and protected by regulations and international laws, as AI can be used without 
limitations and violate human freedom. Finally, higher education institutions should control 
AI, make it serve and not destroy and dehumanise h umankind.  
 
8.     Conclusion  
This research paper investigated the impact of AI on higher education. Therefore, it 
stressed AI's human, ethical and cognitive impacts on the future of humanity in general and 
students and their future careers. Consequently, AI  affects the learning and teaching 
process. For instance, a large part of the participants believe that AI is more efficient than European Jo urnal of Educational Sciences, March 2023 edition Vol.10 No.1  ISSN: 1857 - 6036

 humans when it comes to learning and teaching: 43% strongly agree and 15% agree with 
this idea, in contrast with 7% who strong ly disagree and 10% who disagree, and 25% are 
neutral. The latter finding goes hand in hand with the literature review findings suggested 
by (Chin, 2018; Ma and Siau, 2018; and Jabar and Yousif, 2011). 
Similarly, regarding AI's efficiency, accuracy, and ob jectivity in assessing learners, 
results reveal that the majority agree with this point as 25% strongly agree, 50% agree 
compared to, 10% strongly disagree, 4% disagree, and 1% are neutral. Findings meet with 
the argument of (Mahana et al. 2012; Stanford U niversity, 2019; and Brad Rose consulting 
2019). Additionally, regarding the process of recruiting using AI, findings reveal that the 
most substantial majority prefer a manual method with a percentage of 54% as contrasted 
to a minority choosing an artifici ally intelligent approach with a percentage of 3%, and this 
is an example justifying their choice: "I prefer to be assessed by a human because a human 
can understand what you mean more than a robot. Therefore, the results agree strongly with 
what was discu ssed in the literature review that higher education institutions should prepare 
learners for the new world order of AI (Frey and Osborne, 2013; Oxford University, 2019). 
Finally, academic professionals should be well trained  in artificial intelligence  to provide 
learners with the necessary skills to handle future care concerns. When teaching AI, 
academics should emphasise ethics and humanity first, as AI is a threat to humanity without 
these ideals. Higher education institutions should also maintain control  over AI, ensuring 
that it serves rather than dehumanises humanity.
